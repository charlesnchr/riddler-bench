The question is about a movie where a man is fighting for his life to gain freedom in a large building in an old European city. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setting is an old European city. That makes me think of places like Paris, Rome, or maybe somewhere in Eastern Europe. The building is large, so maybe a castle, a prison, or a historic mansion. The man is fighting for his life and freedom, so it's probably an action or thriller movie.\n\nI'm trying to remember movies set in old European cities with large buildings. One that comes to mind is \"The Count of Monte Cristo.\" It's about a man who seeks revenge after being imprisoned unjustly. The Château d'If is a significant location, which is a large building, an old prison. The main character, Edmond Dantès, fights for his freedom and clear his name.\n\nAnother possibility could be \"The Da Vinci Code,\" but that's more of a mystery with elements of conspiracy. The main character, Robert Langdon, does go through various old European cities and buildings, but I'm not sure if it's specifically about fighting for freedom in a single large building.\n\nWait, there's also \"V for Vendetta,\" but that's set in a dystopian London, and while it's about fighting against oppression, the main character is more of a vigilante. The setting is more futuristic, so maybe not the best fit.\n\nGoing back to \"The Count of Monte Cristo,\" it fits well because the story revolves around betrayal, imprisonment, and the quest for freedom and revenge. The large building, Château d'If, is central to the plot. The man, Edmond Dantès, is definitely fighting for his life and freedom.\n\nI think that's the most likely answer. It's a classic tale and the setting matches the description given in the riddle.\n</think>\n\nThe Count of Monte Cristo", "latency_ms": 1909, "is_exact": false, "is_alias": false, "fuzzy": 8, "is_correct": false}
{"id": "2", "question": "Film where a floating metal giant kisses ice and the seating plan gets very competitive with small boats.", "answer_ref": "Titanic", "aliases": [], "model": "groq:deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this riddle to solve. It says: \"Film where a floating metal giant kisses ice and the seating plan gets very competitive with small boats.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, \"floating metal giant.\" That makes me think of a big metal object floating on water. Maybe a ship? But it's a giant, so perhaps something larger than a regular ship. Oh, wait, the Titanic was a big ship, but it's not metal in the sense of being a robot or something. Or maybe it's a statue? Like the Statue of Liberty, but that's not a giant in the sense of a person.\n\nWait, \"kisses ice.\" So the metal giant interacts with ice. Maybe it's a ship that hits an iceberg? Because icebergs are made of ice, and the ship (which is made of metal) would \"kiss\" the ice when it collides. That makes sense. So the film might be about a ship that sinks after hitting an iceberg.\n\nNext part: \"the seating plan gets very competitive with small boats.\" Seating plan could refer to the arrangement of lifeboats on a ship. If the seating plan is competitive, maybe there's a rush to get into the lifeboats, which are small boats. So the film is about a disaster where people are competing to get into lifeboats, which are in short supply.\n\nPutting it all together: a film about a large metal ship (maybe the Titanic) that hits an iceberg (kisses ice) and then the lifeboats become a point of competition because there aren't enough. So the film is likely \"Titanic.\" That fits because the Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in 1912 after colliding with an iceberg, leading to a tragic situation with the lifeboats.\n\nI don't think it's another ship movie because the Titanic is the most famous one with this scenario. Other possibilities could be \"The Poseidon Adventure\" or \"A Night to Remember,\" but \"Titanic\" is more well-known, especially with the lifeboat competition aspect.\n\nSo, I'm pretty confident the answer is \"Titanic.\"\n</think>\n\nTitanic", "latency_ms": 2114, "is_exact": false, "is_alias": false, "fuzzy": 100, "is_correct": true}

It says, \"Story where a bored office worker learns gravity and bullets take suggestions because reality is a software demo.\" Hmm, that's a bit abstract, but let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the main character is a bored office worker. That makes me think of movies or shows where the protagonist is stuck in a mundane job. The Matrix comes to mind because Neo starts off feeling unfulfilled in his job, but I'm not sure if that's the right fit here.\n\nThe next part says \"learns gravity and bullets take suggestions.\" That sounds like the character discovers that the laws of physics aren't fixed. Maybe they can manipulate gravity or bullets, which reminds me of The Matrix where characters can bend the rules of the simulated reality.\n\nThen it mentions \"reality is a software demo.\" A software demo is like a simulation or a beta version of a program. So, the story is probably about a simulated reality created by some software. The Matrix is all about a simulated reality, so that fits.\n\nPutting it all together: a bored office worker (like Neo) discovers that reality is a simulation (the Matrix) where even physical elements like gravity and bullets can be manipulated because they're part of the software. That makes me pretty confident the answer is The Matrix.\n</think>\n\nThe Matrix", "latency_ms": 1405, "is_exact": false, "is_alias": false, "fuzzy": 100, "is_correct": true}
{"id": "4", "question": "Man who treats a foggy capital as a crossword, using a hat, a pipe, and his roommate's patience.", "answer_ref": "Sherlock Holmes", "aliases": ["Holmes"], "model": "groq:deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b", "answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I've got this riddle to solve. It says, \"Man who treats a foggy capital as a crossword, using a hat, a pipe, and his roommate's patience.\" Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, \"foggy capital\" makes me think of London because it's often associated with fog. So the capital city in question is probably London. Now, the man treats this city as a crossword. That's interesting. Maybe he's solving something related to the city, like a puzzle or a mystery.\n\nNext, the clues mention a hat, a pipe, and his roommate's patience. Those are pretty specific items. A hat and a pipe are iconic accessories for a certain fictional character. I'm thinking of Sherlock Holmes here because he's famous for wearing a deerstalker hat and smoking a pipe. Plus, he's known for solving mysteries in London, which fits the \"foggy capital\" part.\n\nThe mention of a roommate's patience also points to Sherlock Holmes because he lives with Dr. John Watson. Watson is often portrayed as being patient and putting up with Holmes's eccentricities. So, putting it all together, the man in question is Sherlock Holmes. He solves mysteries (like crosswords) in London, uses a hat and pipe, and has a roommate who's patient.\n\nI don't think it's anyone else because the combination of the hat, pipe, and the London setting is so specific to Sherlock Holmes. Plus, the idea of treating the city as a crossword fits his analytical and puzzle-solving nature. So, I'm pretty confident the answer is Sherlock Holmes.\n</think>\n\nSherlock Holmes", "latency_ms": 1525, "is_exact": false, "is_alias": false, "fuzzy": 100, "is_correct": true}

The most famous one that comes to mind is Darth Vader from Star Wars. He's a Sith Lord, so he's definitely a father figure, especially to Luke Skywalker. His breathing is labored because of his life-support suit.\n\nNext, \"with a glow stick.\" Darth Vader is known for his red lightsaber, which is a glowing stick of sorts. That fits the description pretty well.\n\nThen, \"strict HR policies.\" This part is a bit trickier. HR policies usually relate to how a company manages its employees, but in the context of Star Wars, it could refer to the strict rules and discipline within the Galactic Empire. Darth Vader enforces the Emperor's will, which is definitely strict and policy-driven.\n\nPutting it all together, the riddle seems to point towards Darth Vader. He's a space dad with breathing issues, carries a glow stick (lightsaber), and enforces strict policies as a high-ranking officer in the Empire.\n\nI don't think there's another character that fits all these aspects as well as Darth Vader does. Maybe someone like Emperor Palpatine, but he's not really known for having breathing issues or carrying a glow stick. So, yeah, I'm pretty confident it's Darth Vader.\n</think>\n\nDarth Vader", "latency_ms": 1499, "is_exact": false, "is_alias": false, "fuzzy": 100, "is_correct": true}
